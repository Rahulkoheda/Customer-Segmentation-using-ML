# Customer-Segmentation-using-ML
Customer segmentation is a powerful tool that enables businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor their marketing strategies to distinct groups, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing revenue. This project focuses on applying data-driven techniques to segment customers based on behavioral, demographic, and transactional data. We utilize clustering algorithms, including K-means and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique customer segments with similar characteristics. Each segment is analyzed for specific traits, spending patterns, and preferences, allowing for the development of targeted marketing and personalized customer engagement strategies. By implementing effective segmentation, businesses can optimize resource allocation, improve customer retention, and achieve a competitive advantage. The results of this project demonstrate the value of segmentation in enhancing decision-making and driving customer-centric growth.
